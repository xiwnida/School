Notes on working with the model data
-------------------------------------

1. The numbers within the curly brackets ( { and } ) are the actual data.

2. Please keep everything (including the spacing) as it is laid out here,
   only changing the numbers (This helps when hardcoding the data back into
   the compiled code).

3. For negative numbers please keep the minus sign directly in front of the
   number ( e.g. -10   NOT   - 10), errors will result otherwise.

4. From left to right, the (Figures) numbers refer to :-
	
	a - Type of Figthing Unit
	b - Hit Points
	c - Attack Value
	d - Armor Value
	e - Armor versus Missiles
	f - Missile Attack
	g - Missile Range
	h - Missile Rate of Fire
	i - Speed
	j - Frequency
	k - something
	l - something
	m - something
	n - something
