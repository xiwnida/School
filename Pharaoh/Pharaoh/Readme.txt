I. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
Pentium 133 Mhz
32 Mb RAM
Windows 95/98
DirectX 6.1 or higher
--The Pharaoh installer will install DirectX 6.1 if necessary. To reinstall, run \DIRECTX\Dxsetup.exe from the Pharaoh CD.
360 Mb Minimum Install size
100 Mb Swap file on your Windows drive.
4X CD-ROM
Video card with at least 1Mb of Memory capable of 640x480 resolution at 16 bit (High color) color depth

II. GENERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES
----------------------------

For better game performance, we highly recommend exiting all non-essential background programs before running Pharaoh. Pharaoh will also run better if your system has current hardware drivers and a recently defragmented hard drive.

Using animated mouse cursors can create cursor anomalies in Pharaoh. If you encounter problems, restore your windows mouse cursor to its default settings.

To play Pharaoh in Windowed mode, your desktop resolution must be set higher than Pharaoh's game resolution, and your desktop color depth must be set to 16 bit (high color.)

III. GENERAL GAME ISSUES
------------------------

There is a lot of feedback and advice available in Pharaoh, if you are having problems, consult your overseers and info click (right click) on problematic buildings, people, or other items.

The very easy difficulty level is a "Sandbox" mode. Some features of the game are disabled or greatly reduced.

Some missions require you to build multiple monuments. We recommend building one at a time, since the construction foremen of the monuments can be quite competitive, and may issue conflicting orders to your workers. You don't want to see stonemasons working on one monument while stone is being delivered to another.

Soldiers must be able to get to their Forts. Be sure to have a walkable path for the soldiers from the city's Recruiter to the Academy and to the city's Forts.

Many Egyptian cities trade quite a lot of goods. Sometimes the cities are willing to trade a greater total volume of goods than their trade ships and caravans can handle. If you have a particular good from a particular city that you want to buy or sell, then you may need to limit the traders from that city to trading only that good or only a few goods. This will ensure that you are selling valuable beer instead of less valuable barley, or that you are importing the granite needed for the construction of Obelisks, instead of importing less needed luxury goods.

Storage Yard delivery men will attempt to deliver goods in their Storage Yards to buildings that need the goods. If they take a good somewhere that can no longer accept the good, then the delivery men will wait with their cart of goods until they can take the good somewhere. If you see a lot of delivery men standing around doing nothing, try to provide a place for them to take their goods, because they won't do anything else until they can drop off their loads.

Delivery men can briefly appear and disappear in front of their home buildings if they are trying to "Get" a good from somewhere else and cannot "Get" the good for some reason. When delivery men are trying to "Get" food from a Granary, a road connection to the Granary is needed. Lastly, buildings will not "Get" from other buildings that are also "Getting" the same good.

Roads must touch the middle two tiles of a Granary's edge for the Granary to have road access.

On rare occasions, Granaries and Storage Yards can get their special orders settings linked to other Granaries or Storage Yards special orders settings. If this occurs, saving and reloading will fix the problem.

IV. UPDATES TO THE GAME MANUAL
=======================
The following items either changed after the game manual went to press, or weren't covered in the manual at all.  We encourage you to use Pharaoh's extensive in-game Help system, which we continually expanded and updated after we finished the manual. 

CONTROL PANEL
In some missions, particularly the early ones, new structures are introduced as the mission unfolds.  When something new is available, the Control Panel button that accesses it will flash on and off.

"DATA LIMIT REACHED"
Pharaoh has limits on how many buildings, walkers and point-to-point walker routes it can handle.  These limits are quite high, and you should never encounter them in the missions that we included with the game.  Some of Pharaoh's "Custom Missions," though, let you build much larger cities, and you might reach one of these memory limits if you build a city of 35,000 or more people.  If you do see this message, your only recourse is to resculpt your city for greater efficiency.  Populations in excess of 50,000 are possible if you build very efficiently.   

FLOOD PLAIN EMBANKMENT
The boundary between the flood plain and dry land is steep, slippery and treacherous.  No one can move to or from the flood plain unless at least a small stretch of road spans this embankment.  You're most likely to notice this if troops disembark onto a flood plain, or if you notice hunters and gatherers skirting the boundary.

MESSAGES
The Help item on the game's menu bar lets you turn "Popup Messages" OFF.  This means that all game messages go directly to your Message box, except for a few that require you to make an immediate choice (like whether or not to accept a gift).  While turning off the popups does almost entirely eliminate interruptions in your game, it also puts you at considerable risk of missing important notices.  Use this option with extreme caution!

The Message button on the Control Panel blinks when a new, unread message arrives.  It stops flashing when you click on the Message button.

We added a button to the bottom of the Message box that deletes all opened messages, except those tutorial messages that are marked with a blue scroll.  You can delete unopened or blue-scroll messages by right-clicking on them.


MONUMENTS
Monuments have a "staging area" represented by some wooden planks on one side of the monument.  Don't block access to these planks while construction is underway!  Work will stop if workers can't reach the staging area.  If you don't see progress being made, right-click on the monument to find out why.  If the construction foreman reports that access is blocked, he's referring to this staging area.

Masons and bricklayers work in pairs on pyramids and mastabas.  One sledge load of stone or bricks occupies two stonemasons or bricklayers, and fills in two sections of the pyramid or mastaba.

The "Trader's Guide to Pharaoh's Egypt" shows that plain stone, limestone and bricks are needed for the brick core pyramid.  Plain stone is NOT required for this pyramid; only limestone and bricks are needed.

TRANSPORT SHIPS
When a transport ship is selected, pressing the "K" key orders troops to embark or disembark.
